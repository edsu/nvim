# nvim

This is my [neovim](https://neovim.io/) setup that I started experimenting with in December 2021. Typically it goes in `~/.config/nvim`. It has some minor language specific configuration (indents, etc) and also sets up some plugins that I like to use like:

* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline): a visually pleasing & informative status bar
* [vim-pencil](https://github.com/preservim/vim-pencil): some nice defaults for writing prose instead of code
* [vim-pandoc](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc): edit markdown, especially for pandoc
* [markdown-preview](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.vim): view markdown in browser while editing
* [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig): language server support for python, ruby, javascript, etc
* [nvim-tree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua): a file explorer
